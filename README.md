# Dirty Scripts 👻

A collection of (more or less quick n’ dirty) scripts born from everyday tasks and ad-hoc needs.

> Most scripts were written for a specific problem and are stored here for possible future reuse, but also serve as
> inspiration and source of code snippets that can be extracted and recycled for different purposes (hello future me
> 👋🏽).
